Pre-Processing Documentation

1. Compile datasets

a. The California Department of Education keeps record of demographic and performance statistics for every school in the state. Because grades 9-12 have both more temporally consistent data and more detailed metrics, this analysis will be limited to California's public high schools.

b. Below is a list of the data reports collected during pre-processing:
- Absenteeism
- Accountability (SARC: safety, class size, fiscal expenditure, etc.)
- Annual Enrollment
- Assessment
- CALPADS Unduplicated Pupil Count (UPC)
- CBEDS School and District Information
- Discipline
- English Learners
- Foster Youth
- Free or Reduced-Price Meal
- Graduate and Dropout
- Homeless Children and Youth
- Public School and District
- Post-Secondary Enrollment
- Stability Rate Data
- Staff and Course Enrollment

c. Each .txt file first must be converted to a .csv file using pd.to_csv

2. Exploratory Analysis + Process Datasets

a. Create a method that dropss schools such that schools that lack KeyIDs/school name 

b. Find the optimal temporal range (in school years) for analysis
- models that require a set number of years for each school can use all years recorded in dataset
- models that use dynamic sequencing (like RNN) do not require a set number of school years

c. Create method that merges datasets baesd on keyID/school name
